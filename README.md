The goal for this project is to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game completely from scratch. The webpage should provide the user with buttons for selecting a weapon to play, and display key game information as every round is played. Once the user or computer reaches 5 wins, the winner of the overall game is declared and the user can play again.
